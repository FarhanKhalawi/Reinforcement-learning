# RL-Playground

This project was developed as part of the **Reinforcement Learning** course.  
It implements and compares reinforcement learning algorithms on continuous control tasks.  

## Features
- Implementation of custom reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch.  
- Support for continuous action space environments (e.g., LunarLanderContinuous-v3).  
- Custom Gymnasium environment: **Simple1D-v0**.  
- Algorithms included:
  - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
  - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
  - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
